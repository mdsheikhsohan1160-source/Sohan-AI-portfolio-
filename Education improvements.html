    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I’m <strong>Sohan</strong> — a student and AI chatbot developer from Bangladesh.  
        I build chatbots, automation systems, and prompt workflows to help small businesses scale support and save time.  
        I love learning new tech, building real tools, and sharing results with clients.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Beyond technology, I have been passionate about <strong>public speaking and leadership</strong> from a young age.  
        Teachers frequently invited me to speak during school and college events, cultural programs, and important national days.  
        This experience has shaped me into a <strong>confident youth leader</strong> and an experienced professional speaker.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Recently, I joined the <strong>Youth Skill Development Trust</strong> as a student and was selected as a <strong>LeadX Ambassador</strong> for my dedication and leadership skills.  
        I also volunteer with <strong>Acumen Haven</strong>, teaching children about environmental awareness and how to reduce pollution — work I do purely to create meaningful impact.
